# Data-Science
side projects in data science

(1) Using Iris data : find relations between measured quantities and develop model. Generate a random set of data 
 and test models
 
(2) Breast Cancer from Wisconsin data: Develop supervised model to predict if cells from biopsy are malignant or benign.   
 
(3) Use SQLite through python to query a movie rating database that has three different tables. Go though various 
execises to query different parameters. 

(4) Breat Cancer II : Develop supervised model to predict if cells from biopsy are malignant or benign, different dataset/ parameters than first analysis. Implememt random forest model, balancing training data using SMOTE. Calculate cross validation, confusion matrix, and importance of variables (and variability).

(5) Pricing. 

(6) Bike share analysis. Analytics, finding trends. 

(7) Airline market share calculated from NYC taxi drop-off traffic at airports. Unsupervised learning. Implemantation of different clystering algorithms.
